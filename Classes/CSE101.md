# CSE101 - Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Introduction to abstract data types and basics of algorithms. Linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs will be covered. Students will also be taught how to derive big-Oh analysis of simple algorithms. All assignments will be in C/C++. (Formerly Computer Science 101 Algorithms and Abstract Data Types.) Prereqs: CSE 12 or BME 160; CSE 13E or ECE 13 or CSE 13S; and CSE 16; and CSE 30; and MATH 11B or MATH 19B or MATH 20B or AM 11B.

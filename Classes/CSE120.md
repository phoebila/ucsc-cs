# CSE120 - Computer Architecture

Introduction to computer architecture including examples of current approaches and the effect of technology and software. Computer performance evaluation, basic combinatorial and sequential digital components, different instruction set architectures with a focus on the MIPS ISA and RISC paradigm. Evolution of CPU microarchitecture from single-cycle to multi-cycle pipelines, with overview of super-scalar, multiple-issue and VLIW. Memory system, cache, virtual memory and relationship between memory and performance. Evolution of PC system architecture. May include advanced topics, such as parallel processing, MIMD, and SIMD.

Prerequisites:

- [CSE 12](CSE12.md)
- [CSE 13S](CSE13S.md) or CSE 13E
- CSE 15 and CSE 15L
- [CSE 16](CSE16.md) recommended

Remarks:

- Language(s) used: RISC-V
- Very similar to CSE 12, especially first half of quarter
- Pipelining is one of the tricky concepts, along with a CPU diagram
- Taking this class with Renau, make sure to do all the homework and take very good notes, you'll need them for the 2 midterms and bi-weekly quizzes.

Remarks:

- Language(s) used: HTML, JavaScript
- Technlog(ies)/Package(s) used: Three.js
- Professor Davis is really cool!
- Lots of fun projects, including making your own 3D world
- Difficulty lies in the quizzes, even though it's open note and internet, some of the stuff on there are computationally/conceptually difficult to understand (though not impossible)
- Labs have step-by-step instructions for ~85% of the grade, the other 15% is done through own work

This guide is intended to be read by prospective computer science students and incoming freshmen, however, current students may find portions of the text to be useful as well. Includes information on the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science majors, as well as the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Computer Game Design (CSGD) major. Among other things, contains descriptions of relevant courses, discussion on programming languages you will use, requirements to graduate, as well as ratings on professors and classes you will encounter.

## Introduction

The University of California, Santa Cruz, is well known for its beautiful campus and excellent education. The B.S in Computer Science: Computer Game Design degree at UCSC is reported to be in the [top five computer science game design degrees](https://lookout.co/santacruz/ucsc-cabrillo/story/2022-09-15/ucsc-groundbreaking-computer-game-program-top-5-nationally-charts-astonishing-path#:~:text=U.S.%20News%20and%20World%20Report,to%20its%202022%2D23%20analysis.) in the United States. Additionally, the B.S and B.A in Computer Science degree is reported to be [one of the top ten in California, and among the top fifty across the country](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/university-of-california-santa-cruz-110714). We will discuss the differences between the Computer Science Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, and talk about the Computer Science: Computer Game Design degree.

### Quick Note for Non-CS admittees

Computer science at UCSC is impacted, meaning that it is a very popular, difficult major to get admitted into. Unfortunately, this also means that switching into computer science is very difficult. If you want to major in CS and were not admitted, it is a good idea to take another offer that allows you to do CS. Alternatively, you can also do two years of community college and transfer as a junior. That way, you will can get a degree in CS while also saving money.

### What is Computer Science?

"Science" refers to the study of something. Consequently, "computer science" refers to the study of computers. A typical computer science curriculum is composed of studying theory, algorithms, programming languages, and architecture. Computer science students will often find themselves not programming for long periods of time, sometimes even for an entire quarter. Some things that students do other than programming include formulating proofs, plotting diagrams, and writing documentation or writeups on their programs.

### Bachelor of Art or Science?

Both the Bachelor of Art (B.A) and Bachelor of Science (B.S) in Computer Science are great degrees. They are crafted such that students are exposed to "a rigorous curriculum" ([Registrar](https://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/archive/15-16/programs-courses/program-statements/cmps.html)) and their lower division requirements are practically the same. All students have to complete the same Math courses (save for Math 23A), the same Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) courses, and complete CSE 101 in order to graduate. However, the B.A degree offers more flexibility in the upper division electives allowed, while the B.S is designed to prepare the student for research and post-undergraduate programs.

It is easy to switch from a B.S to a B.A, however, switching from a B.A to B.S requires: 
1. An appeal to the university
2. Maintaing good academic standing (3.0 GPA)

Both of the requirements are not terribly difficult, but they do require some planning ahead of time.

### Computer Science: Computer Game Design

- Arrian talk about this -- make similar to above

## Subjects

There are a few subjects that everyone will have to encounter as a computer science major.

- Programming
- Computer Architecture
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Math (CS)
- Operating Systems

And here are some other topics that you may encounter as an upper division elective.

- Databases
- Languages and Compilers
- Distributed Systems
- 3D Modeling
- Computer Networking

### Programming

- What is programming and how is it different than coding
- Talk about programs we would make in our classes (like CSE 30, linkedlist and biginteger and CSE 13s stuff)
- Languages, which is referenced in the other section
- Upper division programming vs lower div

### Computer Architecture

- What is computer architecture
- What is a low-level vs high-level language
- What is assembly

### Algorithms and Data Structures

- What are algorithms and data structures and what are they used for
- What are some algorithms and data structures (LinkedList, Trees, Heap, Graphs)
- Examples (Queue being used in a line, or restaurant)

### Math (CS)

- You will have to take math classes ):
- Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics

### Operating Systems

- Ties into assembly languages
- What your computer is run on
- Low-level languages
- Discuss it

## Languages

You will definitely use these languages.

- Python
- C
- C++
- MIPS / RISC-V

Depending on your electives, you may use these languages.

- JavaScript
- C#
- R
- MatLab
- Haskell (CSE 114A)
- LaTeX

Some useful ones you should definitely consider learning.

- LaTeX
- Markdown
- HTML

### Python

- High-level language
- Lots of libraries
- Will be used extensively in classes

### C

- Low-level language
- Lots of support, blazingly fast
- Will be used extensively in classes

### C++

- Object-oriented programming language with C features
- Like C but with encapsulation, data hiding, abstraction, inheritance, etc
- More libraries and functions to use
- A bit slower than C but still much faster than Python

### MIPS / RISC-V

- Assembly language
- What is it used for?
- How does assembly language work in the overall scheme of things? (C code compiled into binaries how) 

## Graduation Requirements

- Talk about graduation requirements
- Link the graduation requirement website

### General Education

- Maybe take 1 per quarter

### Major Requirements (2020)

- Might be slightly outdated, but this is what we did to graduate
- The major requirements differ for each major, but the lower divisions are fairly similar
- Add something something, link updated page and our 2020 page for graduating

#### B.S in Computer Science

- Upper division more rigid than B.A
- Lots of the classes are required, like CSE 102/103/130
- Expand upon

#### B.A in Computer Science

- Lower divs very similar

## What to Study Before Attending University

1. Learn a language (Rec: Python & C).
2. Learn a second language. Compare and contrast the two, understand what it fully going on underneath everything (like JavaScript's `in` vs. `of` when iterating over an object or how values are being stored in certain programming languages).
3. Read over some proofs.
4. Learn common data structures and algorithms (DSAs).

## Planning for Graduate School

- Graduate school requirements

### Research Experience

- Research is important for graduate school, although not required for a masters degree
- Talk to Professors (look below)

### Talking to Professors

- You NEED 3 recommendation letters for most graduate schools
- Make sure to talk with some professors and do well in their classes
- If you get research experience, even better, can ask them for rec letter later

### Maintain a good GPA

- Talk about some GPA statistics for schools
- GPA is important, but doing stuff outside of classes is important too
  - Do research, talk to professors
  - Make some side projects
- Don't stress about it though, many of our friends have been able to get into graduate school without great GPAs

## Introduction

The University of California, Santa Cruz, is well known for its beautiful campus and excellent education. The B.S in Computer Science: Computer Game Design degree at UCSC is reported to be in the [top five computer science game design degrees](https://lookout.co/santacruz/ucsc-cabrillo/story/2022-09-15/ucsc-groundbreaking-computer-game-program-top-5-nationally-charts-astonishing-path#:~:text=U.S.%20News%20and%20World%20Report,to%20its%202022%2D23%20analysis.) in the United States. Additionally, the B.S and B.A in Computer Science degree is reported to be [one of the top ten in California, and among the top fifty across the country](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/university-of-california-santa-cruz-110714). We will discuss the differences between the Computer Science Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, and talk about the Computer Science: Computer Game Design degree.

### Quick Note for Non-CS admittees

Computer science at UCSC is impacted, meaning that it is a very popular, difficult major to get admitted into. Unfortunately, this also means that switching into computer science (after you have applied) is very difficult. If you want to major in CS and were not admitted, it is a good idea to take another offer that allows you to do CS. Alternatively, you can also do two years of community college and transfer as a junior. That way, you will can get a degree in CS while also saving money.

Additional Note: Majors offered by the Baskin School of Engineering are also impacted, so it is very difficult for students who were admitted to a proposed major outside of BSOE to switch into here. 

### What is Computer Science?

"Science" refers to the study of something. Consequently, "computer science" refers to the study of computers. A typical computer science curriculum is composed of studying theory, algorithms, programming languages, and architecture. Computer science students will often find themselves not programming for long periods of time, sometimes even for an entire quarter. Some things that students do other than programming include formulating proofs, plotting diagrams, and writing documentation or writeups on their programs.

### Bachelor of Art or Science?

Both the Bachelor of Art (B.A) and Bachelor of Science (B.S) in Computer Science are great degrees. They are crafted such that students are exposed to "a rigorous curriculum" ([Registrar](https://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/archive/15-16/programs-courses/program-statements/cmps.html)) and their lower division requirements are practically the same. All students have to complete the same Math courses (save for Math 23A), the same Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) courses, and complete CSE 101 in order to graduate. However, the B.A degree offers more flexibility in the upper division electives allowed, while the B.S is designed to prepare the student for research and post-undergraduate programs.

It is easy to switch from a B.S to a B.A, however, switching from a B.A to B.S requires: 
1. An appeal to the university
2. Maintaing good academic standing (3.0 GPA)

Both of the requirements are not terribly difficult, but they do require some planning ahead of time.

### Computer Science: Computer Game Design

- Arrian talk about this -- make similar to above
- Discuss what is the CSGD major and what exactly do you do
The Computer Science: Game Design degree is a degree offered by the Computational Media Department designed for students who hope to pursue a career in game design and related fields. CSGD majors take mostly the same lower division classes as CS majors (we don't need MATH23A/AM30 nor ECE30) plus some art/game classes(ARTG80G, FILM80V, and CMPM80K). That being said, the degree has a rigorous curriculum that requires devotion to complete. Students in the degree will be well acquainted with the game design loop, rapid prototyping, playtesting, game systems, and Scrum. YOU WILL BE CODING YOUR ASS OFF.

Namely, Computer Science: Game Design degree is most known for its senior capstone series (CMPM 170- 172),an yearlong studio course where you work in a group of 6-12 fellow game design students to create a series of polished games/prototypes for your portfolio. Lectures are formatted to guide you as you progress through your production. After every sprint period, you will present your game and design processes to the TAs and Professors (and if you are lucky, you get to present to the entire class) and write a postmortem about your game.

The course is also taught in conjunction with ARTG 170-172 (the AGPM degree capstone). So be sure to talk to AGPM majors as well. 

Side Note: The state of the 170 series seems to be volatile right now due to some significant changes in the course format. If anything has changed, please contact me. 

Additional Side Note: CSGD is offered by the Computational Media Department. Therefore, someon in CS:GD cannot switch into CS, but someone in CS could switch into CS:GD (there's no going back however). I believe it is common (and quite simple) to double major in CS and CSGD, so if you are interested in that, please consult your advisor. 

## Subjects

There are a few subjects that everyone will have to encounter as a computer science major. Namely,

- Programming - Planning and generating instructions to give to a machine.
- Computer Architecture - The functionality, management, and implementation of computer systems.
- Data Structures - Structure used to hold data, like LinkedLists, Heaps, and Trees.
- Algorithms - Methods of solving problems efficiently using data structure.
- Math (CS) - Math topics like Calculus and Linear Algebra.
- Operating Systems - System software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides services for computer programs.

The following are more topics that students may encounter at UCSC.

- Databases - A structured way to hold data (like a table).
- Languages and Compilers - The way code is interpreted through your system.
- Distributed Systems - A computing environment where components are spread across many computers.
- 3D Modeling - Generating models using modeling software.
- Computer Networking - Interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with one another.

## Languages

You will definitely use these languages.

- Python - High-level language. Slow to compute but fast to write.
- C - Low-level language. Blazingly fast but slow to write. Prone to many errors.
- C++ - Intermediate-level language. Easier to write in relative to C but trades some performance as a result. 
- MIPS / RISC-V - Assembly language. Will be used in Computer Architecture classes (CSE 12/120).

Depending on your interests, you may use these languages.

- JavaScript - High-level language which create mobile and desktop apps, along with full-stack applications.
- C# - High-level language creating mobile and desktop apps, cloud-based services, and more.
- R - Mathematical programming language.
- MatLab - Mathematical programming language.
- Haskell - Functional programming language. Free of side effects, used in Functional Programming classes (CSE 114A).

Some useful ones you should definitely consider learning.

- LaTeX - Powerful and complex markup language.
- Markdown - Fast, simple, and lightweight markup language.
- HTML - The markup standard for web pages.

Languages/Game Engines useful for CSGD students:

C#/Unity - You will be using this in your capstone.
C++/Unreal Engine - You can learn this
Godot - You could learn this if you love FOSS.
Javascript - Learn it. CMPM courses use this A LOT. Also look into P5.js and Twine.  
GLSL/Shader DSL - Good to know, fun to learn.

## Graduation Requirements

Everyone wants to graduate... which means it is imperative that you plan out your classes ahead of time! Below are the requirements to graduate.

### General Education

General education requirements can be found [here](https://registrar.ucsc.edu/enrollment/general-education-requirements.html) at the Registrar. It is recommended that you do not rush through the GEs as they can be finished quite quickly if you take 1 or 2 per quarter. Instead, space them out throughout your undergraduate career, as they are useful in padding classes during difficult quarters.

### Major Requirements (2022-2023)

The curriculum charts can be found [here](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/curriculum-charts) at the university's webpage. More specifically, [B.S in Computer Science](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/curriculum-charts/2022-09/CS_BS_22-23.pdf), [B.A in Computer Science](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/curriculum-charts/2022-09/CS_BA_22-23.pdf), and [B.S in Computer Science: Computer Game Design](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/curriculum-charts/2022-09/CSGD_BS_22-23.pdf).

## Classes

The classes at UCSC are structured such that the subject comes first, followed by their course number, followed by the course title. In other words, `subject course_number - course_title`. Lower division courses range from 1 - 99, upper division courses from 100 - 199, and seminars/graduate courses are 200+. Some common subjects can be seen in the chart below.

| Subject                        | Acronym |
| :----------------------------- | :------ |
| Computer Science & Engineering | CSE     |
| Computational Media            | CMPM    |
| Mathematics                    | MATH    |
| Statistics                     | STAT    |
| Writing                        | WRIT    |

List of Classes:
1. [CSE 20 - Beginning Programming in Python](https://github.com/williamsantosa/ucsc-cs/blob/main/Classes/CSE20.md)
2. [CSE 30 - Programming Abstractions: Python](https://github.com/williamsantosa/ucsc-cs/blob/main/Classes/CSE30.md)

## Professors

There are plenty of Professors at UCSC, all of which are notable in their own field of study. Below are some of the Professors you may meet.

## Preparing for University

Having come into University with minimal Computer Science experience, there are a few I would recommend people to do.

1. Take AP Computer Science (if possible) in High School.
   1. Take community college classes if you can handle the workload. Saves a lot of money and time in the future.
2. Learn a language (Java, Python, or C).
3. Learn a second language. Compare and contrast the two, understand what it fully going on underneath everything (like JavaScript's `in` vs. `of` when iterating over an object or how values are being stored in certain programming languages).
4. Watch a YouTube video about what proofs and assembly language are.
   1. Look at examples of proofs and assembly language.
5. Learn common data structures and algorithms (LinkedList, Tree, Array).

## Planning for Graduate School

There are a few things you should prepare if you are planning on going to graduate school. Namely, talking to professors, having a good GPA, and getting experience in research.

### Talking to Professors

Most graduate schools require 3 recommendation letters from people you have worked with. Consequently, you should try to talk or even work with some of the professors at UCSC. A good way to work with them is to be active and get good grades in their class, then ask if they have any projects they need help on after class or via email. Alternatively, you can also tutor for them and that'll also increase your chances of getting a recommendation letter from them. If there are no opportunities to do so, it also doesn't hurt to ask them for a recommendation letter if you did good in their class.

### Maintain a good GPA

Another major factor in getting into graduate schools is having a good GPA (3.5+). Having this, along with other extracurriculars, is a surefire way to increase your chances of getting into graduate school. After all, undergraduate academics are a good way to measure your likelihood of doing well in graduate school.

### Research Experience

Lastly, research experience is also important for graduate school, although not explicitly required. For a doctorate, research is almost certainly required, however, for a masters degree, it is a great addition but not needed.

## Tips and Tricks

This section will cover some neat tips and tricks we've uncovered during our time at UCSC. Some topics include ways of making money, best locations, and services.

### Tutoring, Reading, & Note Taking

Some of the campus jobs you may run into are tutoring, reading, and note-taking. Tutors are exactly what it sounds like, after completing a class with at least a B, students can apply to teach students. Readers are essentially graders for a class, and note takers take notes for their current class.

#### Baskin School of Engineering (BSOE/RTA System)

The Baskin School of Engineering offers tutor and reader positions for students. Students have to apply [here](https://organization.soe.ucsc.edu/reader-and-tutor-hiring) and specify the class and professor they want to work for. Applications generally open up near the end of the prior quarter.

#### Learning Support Services (LSS)

Learning Support Services sometimes email students with good academic standing to tutor for a recently completed class. Alternatively, students may also apply [here](https://lss.ucsc.edu/) to work as well.

#### Note Taking

Sometimes, if a student has good academic standing, they will get emailed to take notes for a currently enrolled class. They offer $25 per class unit, e.g. $125 for a 5-unit class. I would generally shy away from this offer unless you religiously take notes, as you are required to take notes on every single lecture.

### RateMyProfessor

[RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) is a useful website which has fairly accurate reviews of professors. Keep in mind, however, that most of the people who post a review either loved or hated the professor and will generally have a strong bias.

### Best Locations

- Write introduction paragraph for locations on campus
- Overnight, study, bathrooms, etc

- Expand on this

#### Study Locations

There are a few study locations:
- Science & Engineering Library
- McHenry Library
- Gaming Lab (if you have access)
- DARC 308 (when class is not in session)

Rooms within the library can be reserved [here](https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/reserve-a-study-room) and you can reserve up to a week in advance.

#### Overnight Areas


- Night
Science and Engineering Library (SnE)
McHenry Library

Places that get locked after midnight, so you need to get in before (If you are a night owl)
- Jack's Lounge
- DARC 308
- Music Center

Places you will need keycard access to and special privileges:
- Any Lab in Baskin Engineering 1/2
- (For CSGD/AGPM majors taking the capstone, you will have exclusive access to the Baskin Engineering 1 Game Labs)

Places where it is comfortable to sleep in:

- Baskin Engineering 1 1st floor couches
- Jack's Lounge (if you a hard wood bench kinda person)
- DARC 308
- Music Center
- Baskin Game labs
- Literally anywhere with 2 chairs, a quiet atmosphere, and no people

3. ~~The woods~~ DARC Restrooms

### Services

There are a lot of useful services at UCSC, here are a few.

#### Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS)

Provides counseling for mental health issues. Their website can be found [here](https://caps.ucsc.edu/). 

#### Slug Support Pantry

Food bank for students who cannot afford food. Their website can be found [here](https://basicneeds.ucsc.edu/campus-resources%20/food.html).

#### Disability Resource Center (DRC)

Provides many different services, such as vans, counseling, and DRC status for exams. Depending on the Professor, may take exams in a separate location, online, get extra time, etc. Their website can be found [here](https://drc.ucsc.edu/).

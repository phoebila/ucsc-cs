# A Guide to the University of California, Santa Cruz's Computer Science Majors

This guide is intended to be read by prospective computer science students and incoming freshmen, however, current students may find portions of the text to be useful as well. Includes information on the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science majors, as well as the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Computer Game Design (CSGD) major. Among other things, contains descriptions of relevant courses, discussion on programming languages you will use, requirements to graduate, as well as ratings on professors and classes you will encounter.

2. [Subjects](#Subjects)
3. [Languages](#Languages)
4. we'll add this later after it's finalized

## Introduction

- Introduce the computer science degrees
- BS in CS, BA in CS, BS in CSGD
- State that we will talk about BA vs BS in CS

### Quick Note for Non-CS admittees

- Talk about impacted (CS is impacted)
- Discuss how hard it is to switch into CS, may only be able to take a few CS classes or none at all

### What is Computer Science?

- Define CS (study of computers)
- Theory, algorithms, programming languages, architecture.
- Includes programming, which will happen a lot in lower division
- Proofs (CSE 16), computer architecture (CSE 12/120), etc

### Bachelor of Art or Science?

- Bachelor of Art vs Bachelor of Science
- List out some class requirements
- BA is the same as BS until upper division
- Talk about how one is geared for graduate school and the other provides more flexibility in upper division classes
- Can always switch from BS to BA
- BA to BS requires 3.0 GPA and an appeal

### Computer Science: Computer Game Design

- Arrian talk about this -- make similar to above

## Subjects

There are a few subjects that everyone will have to encounter as a computer science major.

- Programming
- Computer Architecture
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Math (CS)
- Operating Systems

And here are some other topics that you may encounter as an upper division elective.

- Databases
- Languages and Compilers
- Distributed Systems
- 3D Modeling
- Computer Networking

### Programming

- What is programming and how is it different than coding
- Talk about programs we would make in our classes (like CSE 30, linkedlist and biginteger and CSE 13s stuff)
- Languages, which is referenced in the other section
- Upper division programming vs lower div

### Computer Architecture

- What is computer architecture
- What is a low-level vs high-level language
- What is assembly

### Algorithms and Data Structures

- What are algorithms and data structures and what are they used for
- What are some algorithms and data structures (LinkedList, Trees, Heap, Graphs)
- Examples (Queue being used in a line, or restaurant)

### Math (CS)

- You will have to take math classes ):
- Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics

### Operating Systems

- Ties into assembly languages
- What your computer is run on
- Low-level languages
- Discuss it

## Languages

You will definitely use these languages.

- Python
- C
- C++
- MIPS / RISC-V

Depending on your electives, you may use these languages.

- JavaScript
- C#
- R
- MatLab
- Haskell (CSE 114A)
- LaTeX

Some useful ones you should definitely consider learning.

- LaTeX
- Markdown
- HTML

### Python

- High-level language
- Lots of libraries
- Will be used extensively in classes

### C

- Low-level language
- Lots of support, blazingly fast
- Will be used extensively in classes

### C++

- Object-oriented programming language with C features
- Like C but with encapsulation, data hiding, abstraction, inheritance, etc
- More libraries and functions to use
- A bit slower than C but still much faster than Python

### MIPS / RISC-V

- Assembly language
- What is it used for?
- How does assembly language work in the overall scheme of things? (C code compiled into binaries how) 

## Graduation Requirements

- Talk about graduation requirements
- Link the graduation requirement website

### General Education

- Link GE website
- Talk about the 10 things you need, and overview of what they are
- Maybe take 1 per quarter

### Major Requirements (2020)

- Might be slightly outdated, but this is what we did to graduate
- The major requirements differ for each major, but the lower divisions are fairly similar
- Add something something, link updated page and our 2020 page for graduating

#### B.S in Computer Science

- Lower divs very similar
- Upper division more rigid than B.A
- Lots of the classes are required, like CSE 102/103/130
- Expand upon

#### B.A in Computer Science

- Lower divs very similar
- More elective choices and more electves in general
- Less required classes (like CSE 130)
- Expand upon

#### B.S in Computer Science: Computer Game Design

- Arrian talk about this

## Key Terms

- Abstractions
- Programming
- Scripting
- Diagram
- Etc just add stuff

## Classes

- Add for all classes we'll take
- Introduce UCSC classes, what are some of the common ones we'll see CSE is Computer Science & Engineering, CMPM is Computational Media, etc...
- Add a remark that some people might find the difficulties higher or lower depending on the subject and mastery coming into university

Format example (description just take from courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse30 lol):

**CSE 30 - Programming Abstractions: Python**

Introduction to software development in Python focusing on structuring software in terms of objects endowed with primitive operations. Introduces concepts and techniques via a sequence of concrete case studies. Coursework consists of programming assignments and a final examination.

- Introduce some Professors

Format example:

**Professor Darrell Long ([RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=304658))**

Longtime Professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Quality: ![](./Media/5star.png)
Difficulty: ![](./Media/5star.png)

## What to Study Before Attending University

1. Learn a language (Rec: Python & C).
2. Learn a second language. Compare and contrast the two, understand what it fully going on underneath everything (like JavaScript's `in` vs. `of` when iterating over an object or how values are being stored in certain programming languages).
3. Read over some proofs.
4. Learn common data structures and algorithms (DSAs).

## Planning for Graduate School

- Graduate school requirements

### Research Experience

- Research is important for graduate school, although not required for a masters degree
- Talk to Professors (look below)

### Talking to Professors

- You NEED 3 recommendation letters for most graduate schools
- Make sure to talk with some professors and do well in their classes
- If you get research experience, even better, can ask them for rec letter later

### Maintain a good GPA

- Talk about some GPA statistics for schools
- GPA is important, but doing stuff outside of classes is important too
  - Do research, talk to professors
  - Make some side projects
- Don't stress about it though, many of our friends have been able to get into graduate school without great GPAs

## Tips and Tricks

- Briefly talk about tips and tricks, what the section includes
- Some useful stuff

### Tutoring & Reading & Note Taking

- Discuss what tutoring and reading is, the difference between the two
- Talk about the pay, provide links
- Introduce the following types of tutoring and reading

#### Learning Support Services (LSS)

- https://lss.ucsc.edu/

#### Baskin School of Engineering (BSOE/RTA System)

- https://organization.soe.ucsc.edu/reader-and-tutor-hiring

#### Note Taking

- Sometimes get emailed for taking notes for your classes
- $25/unit

### RateMyProfessor

- https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/

### Best Locations

- Write introduction paragraph for locations on campus
- Overnight, study, bathrooms, etc

#### Study Locations

- Introduce study locations
- Science & Engineering (with friends)
- McHenry (with friends)
- Game Lab (if you have access)
- Talk about how you can reserve a spot, add links

#### Overnight Areas

- Arrian's speciality add stuff here

#### Bathrooms

- Best and worst bathrooms (link to the reddit post lmao)

# A Guide to the University of California, Santa Cruz's Computer Science Majors

This guide is intended to be read by prospective computer science students and incoming freshmen, however, current students may find portions of the text to be useful as well. Includes information on the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science majors, as well as the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Computer Game Design (CSGD) major. Among other things, contains descriptions of relevant courses, discussion on programming languages you will use, requirements to graduate, as well as ratings on professors and classes you will encounter.

## What to Study Before Attending University

1. Learn a language (Rec: Python & C).
2. Learn a second language. Compare and contrast the two, understand what it fully going on underneath everything (like JavaScript's `in` vs. `of` when iterating over an object or how values are being stored in certain programming languages).
3. Read over some proofs.
4. Learn common data structures and algorithms (DSAs).

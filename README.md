# A Guide to the University of California, Santa Cruz's Computer Science Majors

This guide is intended to be read by prospective computer science students and incoming freshmen, however, current students may find portions of the text to be useful as well. Includes information on the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science majors, as well as the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Computer Game Design (CSGD) major. Among other things, contains descriptions of relevant courses, discussion on programming languages you will use, requirements to graduate, as well as ratings on professors and classes you will encounter.

## Introduction

- Introduce the computer science degrees
- BS in CS, BA in CS, BS in CSGD
- State that we will talk about BA vs BS in CS

### Quick Note for Non-CS admittees

- Talk about impacted (CS is impacted)
- Discuss how hard it is to switch into CS, may only be able to take a few CS classes or none at all

### What is Computer Science?

- Define CS (study of computers)
- Theory, algorithms, programming languages, architecture.
- Includes programming, which will happen a lot in lower division
- Proofs (CSE 16), computer architecture (CSE 12/120), etc

### Bachelor of Art or Science?

- Bachelor of Art vs Bachelor of Science
- List out some class requirements
- BA is the same as BS until upper division
- Talk about how one is geared for graduate school and the other provides more flexibility in upper division classes
- Can always switch from BS to BA
- BA to BS requires 3.0 GPA and an appeal

### Computer Science: Computer Game Design

- Arrian talk about this -- make similar to above

## Subjects

There are a few subjects that everyone will have to encounter as a computer science major.

- Programming
- Computer Architecture
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Math (CS)
- Operating Systems

And here are some other topics that you may encounter as an upper division elective.

- Databases
- Languages and Compilers
- Distributed Systems
- 3D Modeling
- Computer Networking

### Programming

- What is programming and how is it different than coding
- Talk about programs we would make in our classes (like CSE 30, linkedlist and biginteger and CSE 13s stuff)
- Languages, which is referenced in the other section
- Upper division programming vs lower div

### Computer Architecture

- What is computer architecture
- What is a low-level vs high-level language
- What is assembly

### Algorithms and Data Structures

- What are algorithms and data structures and what are they used for
- What are some algorithms and data structures (LinkedList, Trees, Heap, Graphs)
- Examples (Queue being used in a line, or restaurant)

### Math (CS)

- You will have to take math classes ):
- Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics

### Operating Systems

- Ties into assembly languages
- What your computer is run on
- Low-level languages
- Discuss it

## Languages

You will definitely use these languages.

- Python
- C
- C++
- MIPS / RISC-V

Depending on your electives, you may use these languages.

- JavaScript
- C#
- R
- MatLab
- Haskell (CSE 114A)
- LaTeX

Some useful ones you should definitely consider learning.

- LaTeX
- Markdown
- HTML

## What to Study Before Attending University

1. Learn a language (Rec: Python & C).
2. Learn a second language. Compare and contrast the two, understand what it fully going on underneath everything (like JavaScript's `in` vs. `of` when iterating over an object or how values are being stored in certain programming languages).
3. Read over some proofs.
4. Learn common data structures and algorithms (DSAs).
